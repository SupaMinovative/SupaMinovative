Hi there 👋

I’m **Min** — a self-taught and passionate beginner in Java ☕ and Android Development 📱, with a growing interest in software development as a whole. I'm excited to explore all opportunities in tech, from building apps to solving real-world problems through code.

**The more I'm captivated by how just a few lines of code can bring ideas to life, the more I'm inspired to keep following this path.**

## 🔭 My first real-world app: 

[Sprax](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/Sprax) a vocabulary learning app for German learners.

## 🎮 Second project:
 [Guessify](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/Guessify) a word-guessing game built in Java, featuring LiveData and Room DB for a reactive, rewarding experience.
 
## 🔐 Authentication project:

[Simple Login UI](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/simple-login-ui), an Android app built with Java and Room DB (SQLite). Includes user registration, login with validation, and local data storage. It also bridges nicely into backend tech like Spring Boot and PostgreSQL, which I’m currently learning.

## 💚 A tiny taste of JavaScript:

[Dino worries, Bee happy](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/dino-worries-bee-happy) a small interactive web app spreading positive vibes.

## 💼 A simple business site:

[CW](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/CW) a single-page website including a pricing form with PHP-based submission and client-side validation for a better user experience

## 🌱  Currently focused on:

• Deepening Java skills

• Mastering database concepts

• Writing clean, maintainable code

• Turning theory into meaningful, real-world projects


## 🎯 Goal: 

To build a strong foundation in IT and pursue further education (Duales Studium) in software development.

## 🌍 Languages:

• English (C1)

• German 🇩🇪 (C1)

• Thai 🇹🇭 (Native)
