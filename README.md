Hi there 👋

Hi, I’m Min — a self-taught and passionate beginner in Java ☕ and Android Development 📱, with a growing interest in software development as a whole. I'm excited to explore all opportunities in tech, from building apps to solving real-world problems through code.

**The more I'm captivated by how just a few lines of code can bring ideas to life, the more I'm inspired to keep following this path.**

🔭 My first real-world app: [Sprax](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/Sprax) a vocabulary learning app for German learners.

🎮 Second project: [Guessify](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/Guessify) a word guessing game built in Java, featuring LiveData and Room DB for a reactive, rewarding experience.
 
🔐Check out my [Simple Login UI](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/simple-login-ui), an Android app built with Java and Room DB (SQLite). It features user registration, login with validation, and local data storage, demonstrating core authentication concepts. This project helps me connect my Android skills to backend tech like Spring Boot and PostgreSQL, which I’m currently learning.

💚 A tiny taste of JavaScript: [Dino worries, Bee happy](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/dino-worries-bee-happy) an interactive web app spreading positive vibes.

💼 A single-page landing business website [CW](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/CW) implementing a price quotation form with PHP-based form submission and client-side validation for enhanced user experience and data integrity.

🌱 I’m currently focused on deepening my skills in java, databases, and clean coding principles—turning theory into meaningful real-world projects.

🎯 Goal: To build a strong foundation in IT and pursue further education in the field.

🌍 Languages: English (C1), German 🇩🇪 (C1), Thai 🇹🇭 (Native)
