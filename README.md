Hi there 👋

I'm Min — a self-taught, passionate beginner in Android Development 📱 and Java ☕


🔭 My first real-world app: [Sprax](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/Sprax): a vocabulary learning app for German learners.

🎮 Second project: [Guessify](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/Guessify): a word guessing game built in Java, featuring LiveData and Room DB for a reactive, rewarding experience.

💚 A tiny taste of JavaScript: [Dino worries, Bee happy](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/dino-worries-bee-happy): an interactive web app spreading positive vibes.


🌱 I’m currently focused on deepening my skills in mobile development, databases, and clean coding principles—turning theory into meaningful real-world projects.
