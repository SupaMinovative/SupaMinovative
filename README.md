I'm Min — a self-taught, passionate beginner in Android Development 📱 and Java ☕


🔭 My first real-world app: [Sprax](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/Sprax) a vocabulary learning app for German learners.

🎮 Second project: [Guessify](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/Guessify) a word guessing game built in Java, featuring LiveData and Room DB for a reactive, rewarding experience.

💚 A tiny taste of JavaScript: [Dino worries, Bee happy](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/dino-worries-bee-happy) an interactive web app spreading positive vibes.

💼 A single-page landing business website [CW](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/CW) implementing a price quotation form with PHP-based form submission and client-side validation for enhanced user experience and data integrity.

🌱 I’m currently focused on deepening my skills in mobile development, databases, and clean coding principles—turning theory into meaningful real-world projects.

🎯 Goal: To build a strong foundation in IT and pursue further education in the field.
