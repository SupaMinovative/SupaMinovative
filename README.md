Hi there 👋

I’m **Min** — a self-taught and passionate Junior Android Developer 📱 with solid Java ☕ skills and a strong drive to keep growing. I’ve built Android apps using MVVM architecture, Room Database, RecyclerView, and multithreading — while constantly deepening my knowledge and sharpening my skills in software development.

My passion for IT keeps growing, and programming has become more than just a skill — it's my hobby and creative outlet. It turns abstract ideas into real, meaningful apps. **The more I see how a few lines of code can bring concepts to life, the more inspired I am to keep following this path.**

I’m excited to take on real challenges, build impactful apps, and grow into a strong, versatile developer.


## My most fully developed,

independently built app so far.

[Simple Shopping Cart](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/SimpleShoppingCart) 

Built from scratch in Java — integrated LiveData, ViewModel, and custom logic into a real-time shopping cart app with local login (Room & SharedPreferences) and a dynamic UI.

Proud to share this — it brought together everything I’ve learned so far.

## 🔭 My first real-world app: 

[Sprax](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/Sprax) a vocabulary learning app for German learners.

## 🎮 Second project:
 [Guessify](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/Guessify) a word-guessing game built in Java, featuring LiveData and Room DB for a reactive, rewarding experience.

## 💚 A tiny taste of JavaScript:

[Dino worries, Bee happy](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/dino-worries-bee-happy) a small interactive web app spreading positive vibes.

## 💼 A simple business site:

[CW](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/CW) a single-page website including a pricing form with PHP-based submission and client-side validation for a better user experience

## 🌱  Currently focused on:

• Deepening Java skills

• Mastering database concepts

• Writing clean, maintainable code

• Turning theory into meaningful, real-world projects


## 🎯 Goal: 

To build a strong foundation in IT and pursue further education in software development.

## 🌍 Languages:

• English (C1)

• German 🇩🇪 (C1)

• Thai 🇹🇭 (Native)


Feel free to check out my projects and follow my journey! ⭐

## 🤝 Let’s connect

Open to collaboration, internships, or entry-level roles in Android, Java, software or web development.
