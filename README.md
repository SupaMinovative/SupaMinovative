Hi there 👋

I’m **Min** — a self-taught and passionate beginner in Java ☕ and Android Development 📱, with a growing interest in software development as a whole. I'm excited to explore all opportunities in tech, from building apps to solving real-world problems through code.

**The more I'm captivated by how just a few lines of code can bring ideas to life, the more I'm inspired to keep following this path.**

## My most fully developed,

independently built app so far.

[Simple Shopping Cart](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/SimpleShoppingCart) 

Built from scratch in Java — simulates the logic of a real-world shopping cart with full-screen product display, live cart updates with pricing and quantity controls, and local user authentication using Room Database and SharedPreferences.

Proud to represent this one — it’s where all my skills came together!

## 🔭 My first real-world app: 

[Sprax](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/Sprax) a vocabulary learning app for German learners.

## 🎮 Second project:
 [Guessify](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/Guessify) a word-guessing game built in Java, featuring LiveData and Room DB for a reactive, rewarding experience.

## 💚 A tiny taste of JavaScript:

[Dino worries, Bee happy](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/dino-worries-bee-happy) a small interactive web app spreading positive vibes.

## 💼 A simple business site:

[CW](https://github.com/SupaMinovative/CW) a single-page website including a pricing form with PHP-based submission and client-side validation for a better user experience

## 🌱  Currently focused on:

• Deepening Java skills

• Mastering database concepts

• Writing clean, maintainable code

• Turning theory into meaningful, real-world projects


## 🎯 Goal: 

To build a strong foundation in IT and pursue further education (Duales Studium) in software development.

## 🌍 Languages:

• English (C1)

• German 🇩🇪 (C1)

• Thai 🇹🇭 (Native)
